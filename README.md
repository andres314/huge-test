# Coding challenge for Huge

This is the coding challenge for Huge by [Andy Pi](mailto:andy@threefourteen.com.ar). It follows the instruccions on the PDF and you could find each step tagged on git(step1, step2, etc), but keep in mind the last version is the functional one with carries some little improvement or changs on code and styles.
I opted to use webpack as development serve but also compiler from ES6, as I thought it would be interesting to build the appointment app using web components.

# Steps to run the app

- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
